# Key Quest

This is a simple memory game for the DE1-SoC board implemented in C

The game will generate a random letter in which the user has to type back and confirm. The next level, the number of letters the user has to type back will increase by 1. This goes on until the user makes a mistake, or they beat level 10

If at any point the user makes a mistake, its game over! The game starts back again at level 1

If the user is able to beat level 10, then they win!
