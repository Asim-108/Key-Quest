# Key Quest

This is a simple memory game for the DE1-SoC board implemented in C

The game will generate a random letter in which the user has to type back and confirm. The next level, the number of letters the user has to type back will increase by 1. This goes on until the user makes a mistake, or they beat level 10

If at any point the user makes a mistake, its game over! The game starts back again at level 1

If the user is able to beat level 10, then they win!

Operating Instructions:
- At the start menu, the user can press any key to start the game

- At the beginning of each level, the level will display on the screen and HEX display

- The computer will show a series of letters

- After the computer finishes showing the letters, the user should type the letters out again one by one in the order they were shown

- Ignore capitals (type inputs in all lowercase)

- Continue until you beat level 10 (if you can)

- If you make a mistake, no worries! Restart from level 1 and try again
